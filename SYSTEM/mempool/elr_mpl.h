/*! \file elr_mpl.h.
 *  \brief the interface define header file of the memory pool.
 *  \author 唐锐

 *
 *  memory of the memory pool is managed with node and slice. node is big 
 *  memory block, slice is small memory block from node. each memory block
 *  allocated from this memory pool is belong to a slice. 
 *  
 *  all slices of a memory pool is of the same size. so this memory pool is
 *  more like a object pool, as all memory block alloced from a memory pool
 *  has the same size. but we can implement a more flexible memory pool by
 *  use many memory pool of different slice size.
 *
 *  node is linked as list, available slice also linked as list. when alloc
 *  memory form the memory pool. first check whether a free slice is exist. 
 *  if exist take one. if not, check whether the newly allocated node has a
 *  never used slice. if has, take a slice form the node. if does not, move 
 *  it to the head of node list and alloc a node and take a slice from it. 
 *  when free a memory block, just move it to the head of available slice
 *  list.
 *
 *  this memory pool is organized in tree structure. when create a memory 
 *  pool, we can specify its parent memory pool by use a pointer to the
 *  parent pool as the first parameter for elr_mpl_create function. when a
 *  memory pool is destroyed it`s child memory pool also be destroyed, so
 *  when we do not need destroy the memory pool and it`s child memory pool 
 *  just destory the parent memory pool. if we do not specify the parent 
 *  pool any more. if we do not specify the parent memory pool when create a
 *  memory pool, the memory pool`s parent memory pool is the global memory 
 *  pool, from which all memory pool`s memory is a allocated. this means we 
 *  can destroy all memory pool by invoke elr_mpl_finalize function.
 *  
 *  this memory pool also support muti-threading using. if we want it works
 *  in muti-theading entironment, we must implement all the six interface
 *  defined in file elr_mtx.h and define ELR_USE_THREAD. fortunately, it is
 *  a very easy job, and the implementation of windows platform is already
 *  provided.
 *
 *  when i make the windows implementation, i take linux into consideration.
 *  so the atomic counter(interger) type and counter value type is defined
 *  separately. under windows there are not a atomic type, just a LONG
 *  illuminated by volatile. we can make assignment between LONG and volatile
 *  LONG. but under linux atomiccounter(interger) type is defined as follow.
 *  typedef struct  {  volatile int counter;  }  atomic_t; .
 *  assignment between int and atomic_t is against the c language syntax.
 *
 *  this memory pool had been used in manay production environment and its
 *  ability had been proved. there is still plenty of space for improvement.
 *  now each memory pool has its own mutex, under many circumstance this is
 *  not a must. so thera are at least two point need to be improved.
 *  first, reduce the mutex consume. second, make it to be a all-purpose
 *  memory pool, like appache memory pool, many regular size of memory can be
 *  be allocated from it.
